## Purpose of site

This site is a way to document the replication of France Krisnich's article [Understanding the quality change implied by multilateral price indexes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385980567_Understanding_the_quality_change_implied_by_multilateral_price_indexes).

As the code is provided as a set of R code and is based on a custom set of data, this repo is to replicate this research with public data.
